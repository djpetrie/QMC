# Quantum Monte Carlo

A program which determine the ground state energy of the helium atom using a variation Monte Carlo approach.

## Description

In principle the ground state energy of a system can be detemined by solving Schrodinger's equation given the appropriate Hamiltonian, with the eigenvalue equation yielding the wavefunction as the eigenvector, and the energy as the corresponding eigenvalue. In practice anything more complicated than a hydrogen atom becomes an n-body problem with no closed form analytic solution. 
This program demonstrates the effectiveness of using a Monte Carlo method to handle the multidimensional integrals in problems that are computationally intensive.
